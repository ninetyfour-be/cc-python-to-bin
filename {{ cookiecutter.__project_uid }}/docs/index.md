Hey, {{ cookiecutter.client_name }}!

Thanks for your order! I'm really glad you trusted me to help you on your project. You might have seen it on the gig description, but here are some important information about the built executables you ordered.

First, depending on the chosen operating systems, the binaries are built and tested in virtual machines running one of the following versions:
- Windows 10
- MacOS 11 *"Big Sur"*
- Linux 4.4 (Ubuntu 16.04.7 *"Xenial"*)

They should be compatible with any newer release of these operating systems (*e.g*, using a Windows 10 build on Windows 11 should work flawlessly).

Next, I try to do my best with regard to quality assessment and test all the builds myself inside the above mentionned virtual machines. Still, I recommend testing it on the different target operating systems to make sure everything works as you expect and ask for any modification or fix (This is what revisions are for). Indeed, the virtual machines I use have limited rights, meaning that your program might not completely work on them while it would work on an actual machine running the same operating system.

In the rest of this document, I provide some hints about how to use the delivered executables.
